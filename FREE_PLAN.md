# Installation Instructions

### Download and Run the Free Version

Installation and running is very simple. Just pull and run the docker container specified in the `pull` command section.

```
// Pull the image
docker pull dockerstoretemp/storedemo/dc-banner-free:1.0

// Run the image
docker run --rm dockerstoretemp/storedemo/dc-banner-free:1.0
```

You should see the DockerCon banner printed out. The container should exit by itself.
